# HoloCord Architecture & Future Development Threads

## Current State
A Discord bot system enabling multi-model AI conversations through virtual users (webhook-based AI personas). Models from OpenRouter can be dynamically added as Discord users that respond to mentions.

## Core Components

### 1. Main Bot (`llmcord.py`)
- Single model Discord bot with OpenAI-compatible API support
- Message chaining and context management
- Admin permission system
- Configurable via YAML

### 2. Multi-Model System (`llmcord_multimodel.py`)
- Extends base bot with multi-model processing
- Detects @mentions of multiple models
- Parallel model querying
- Response aggregation

### 3. Virtual Users (`virtual_users.py`)
- Webhook-based AI personas
- Dynamic model registration
- Slash commands for management
- Persistent configuration in JSON

### 4. Modular Utilities
- `admin_checker.py`: Centralized permission checking
- `openrouter_client.py`: OpenRouter API abstraction
- `webhook_manager.py`: Discord webhook operations
- `openrouter_models.py`: Model discovery and filtering

### 5. MCP Discord Server (TypeScript)
- 16+ Discord management tools
- Batch operations support
- Minimal intents version available

## Future Development Threads

- Conversation memory per virtual user
- Presence/status updates
- Virtual user "moods" based on context

**Benefits**:
- More engaging multi-model conversations
- Model personality differentiation
- Improved user experience

### Thread 3: Advanced Permission & Rate Limiting
**Goal**: Enterprise-grade access control and resource management

**Key Tasks**:

- Per-user rate limiting with token buckets
- Channel-specific model permissions
- Cost tracking per user/role
- Usage quotas and alerts
- Admin dashboard for permission management

**Benefits**:
- Prevent abuse
- Cost control
- Fine-grained access management

### Thread 4: Model Registry & Discovery
**Goal**: Dynamic model ecosystem with auto-discovery

**Key Tasks**:

- Model capability detection (vision, code, etc.)
- Performance benchmarking system
- Model recommendation based on task
- A/B testing framework for models
- Model deprecation handling

**Benefits**:
- Always up-to-date model list
- Optimal model selection
- Cost optimization

### Thread 5: Conversation Intelligence
**Goal**: Smart conversation management and context optimization

**Key Tasks**:
- Intelligent context windowing
- Conversation summarization for long threads
- Cross-model conversation memory
- Semantic conversation search
- Auto-generate conversation titles
- Export conversations to various formats

**Benefits**:
- Better long conversation handling
- Improved context relevance
- Conversation analytics

### Thread 6: MCP Integration (Future)
**Goal**: Transform into MCP-first architecture

**Key Tasks**:
- Wrap existing functionality as MCP servers
- Create Python MCP client
- Enable tool sharing between models
- Build MCP tool registry
- Implement MCP-based workflows
- Create MCP permission model

**Benefits**:
- Universal tool compatibility
- Language-agnostic integrations
- Ecosystem participation

### Thread 7: Monitoring & Analytics
**Goal**: Comprehensive observability and insights

**Key Tasks**:
- Response time tracking per model
- Error rate monitoring
- Cost analytics dashboard
- User engagement metrics
- Model performance comparison
- Automated health checks
- Prometheus metrics export

**Benefits**:
- Performance optimization
- Cost visibility
- Usage insights

### Thread 8: Advanced Multi-Model Features
**Goal**: Unique multi-model conversation capabilities

**Key Tasks**:
- Model debate mode (models argue different positions)
- Consensus mode (models must agree on answer)
- Chain-of-thought aggregation
- Model voting system
- Expertise routing (route questions to best model)
- Model collaboration protocols

**Benefits**:
- Novel AI interaction patterns
- Improved response quality
- Research opportunities

### Thread 9: Developer Experience
**Goal**: Make the bot easily deployable and configurable

**Key Tasks**:
- Docker containerization
- Kubernetes deployment manifests
- Terraform infrastructure as code
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Development environment setup script
- Configuration validation tools

**Benefits**:
- Easy deployment
- Reduced setup friction
- Better contributor experience

### Thread 10: Community Features
**Goal**: Enable community-driven development

**Key Tasks**:
- Plugin marketplace
- Model review/rating system
- Shared prompt library
- Community model recommendations
- Usage statistics sharing (opt-in)
- Public model benchmarks

**Benefits**:
- Community engagement
- Crowdsourced optimization
- Shared knowledge base

## Implementation Priority

## Technical Debt to Address
1. Duplicate code between `llmcord.py` and `llmcord_multimodel.py`
2. Hardcoded configuration paths
3. Limited error handling in webhook operations
4. No unit tests
5. Inconsistent logging
6. Missing type hints
7. No connection pooling for HTTP clients

## Success Metrics
- Response time < 2s for 95% of requests
- Support for 50+ concurrent models
- 99.9% uptime for virtual users
- < 1% error rate for model queries
- Cost per response < $0.01 average
- Plugin ecosystem with 10+ community plugins
- 100+ active virtual users across servers

## Security Considerations
- API key rotation mechanism
- Webhook URL encryption
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input sanitization for prompts
- Admin action audit logs
- Secure model credential storage
- Discord token refresh handling

## Migration Path
1. Keep existing `llmcord.py` stable
2. Build new architecture in parallel
3. Migrate features incrementally
4. Maintain backwards compatibility
5. Deprecate old code gradually
6. Document migration for users

This architecture roadmap provides a clear path from the current multi-model bot to a comprehensive, scalable AI conversation platform that can grow with the ecosystem and community needs.
